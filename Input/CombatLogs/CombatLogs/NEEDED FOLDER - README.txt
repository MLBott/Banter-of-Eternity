Combat Logs Mod for PoE2 for some reason can sometimes place logs outside of the 'CombatLogs' folder,
so this folder is a placeholder, so that the combat logs are still placed in the main 'CombatLogs' folder.

Try setting your in-game folder destination to store combat logs in Unity Mod Manager settings to C://<folder paths>/BanterOfEternity/Input/CombatLogs/CombatLogs
